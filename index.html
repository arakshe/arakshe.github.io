    <h1>Startup Funding Analysis Report</h1>

    <p><strong>Group Members:</strong> Anvi Rakshe, Manika Sakulsureeyadej, Mehek Daga</p>
    <p>This report presents an analysis of startup funding rounds and behavior using several interactive visualizations developed in D3.js. We explore patterns in funding rounds, amounts, geography, and startup life cycle outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Sankey Diagram – Funding Flow</h2>
    <p>
      This Sankey diagram visualizes the flow of startups through different stages of funding rounds—grouped into 1–3 rounds, 4–6 rounds, and 7+ rounds—and how these stages connect to various funding sources. Venture capital dominates early funding, while mature startups diversify into private equity, post-IPO options, and debt financing.

    <h2>Bar Chart – Funding Rounds Distribution</h2>
    <p>
      This bar chart shows how many startups fall into each funding round group. The chart highlights the sharp drop-off after early funding rounds, illustrating both the challenge of continued growth and natural attrition in the startup ecosystem.

    <h2>Box Plot – Funding Amount Distribution</h2>
    <p>
      This box plot presents statistical distribution of funding amounts across startup categories. It displays medians, interquartile ranges, and outliers to help identify funding variability. Outliers reveal unusually high or low investments.

    <h2>Map – SF Bay Area Startup Distribution</h2>
    <p>
      This interactive map shows where startups are located in the San Francisco Bay Area. It visualizes clusters of innovation and helps identify regional patterns in startup funding and activity, especially around San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

    <h2>Scatter Plot – Startup Age vs. Total Funding</h2>
    <p>
      This scatter plot explores the relationship between startup age and total funding, segmented by company status (operating, acquired, closed). It helps us understand whether age correlates with funding success and startup outcomes.

    <h2>Stacked Bar Chart – Funding by Market and Round</h2>
    <p>
      This stacked bar chart presents the distribution of funding rounds across different market sectors. Each bar represents a market, with segments indicating the contribution of individual funding rounds (e.g., seed, round_a, round_b, etc.).

    <h3>1. Top Funded Markets</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Software</strong> is the highest-funded market, with total funding nearing $7 billion. It also has contributions from almost every round, especially rounds A to D. 
      <strong>Biotechnology</strong> follows closely, with a slightly more balanced distribution across early (seed, round_a) and later rounds (round_b to round_d). 
      Enterprise Software, Clean Technology, and Health Care round out the top five.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Funding Round Distribution</h3>
    <p>
      Early rounds (seed, round_a) are present across all markets, indicating strong investment activity at the early startup stage. 
      Later rounds (round_e to round_h) are rare and only show up in top-funded sectors like Software, Biotech, and Semiconductors. 
      Round_a and round_b are the most prevalent rounds across the board, showing that many startups are making it past the seed stage but fewer proceed to advanced rounds.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Diversity Across Markets</h3>
    <p>
      Some markets like “Games” and “Advertising” show a healthy range of round progression (from seed through round_d), suggesting sustained investor interest. 
      Niche markets like File Sharing, Communities, and Big Data have significantly lower total funding and fewer funding rounds involved, possibly indicating limited scalability or investor appetite.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Funding Gaps</h3>
    <p>
      Markets like Social Media, Messaging, and Finance seem underfunded compared to Software and Biotech, which might suggest either market saturation or higher capital efficiency. 
      Solar and Storage have moderate investment but lack late-stage funding, possibly due to long development timelines or hardware-heavy requirements.
