    <h1>Startup Funding Analysis Report</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Startup funding is a key factor in how successful a business can be. It drives growth, supports innovation, and gives us a bigger picture of what’s happening in the market and economy. By looking at where the money is going, through different funding rounds, funding types, and company stages, we can learn a lot about what helps startups grow and what attracts investors. This kind of insight is valuable for entrepreneurs looking to grow their companies, for investors looking for the next big opportunity.</p>

    <p>In this project, we’re analyzing startup funding trends in the San Francisco Bay Area — one of the top places in the world for tech and innovation. We’re looking at how funding changes depending on the stage of the company, its location, and the type of funding it receives. Our goal is to spot patterns that show what makes startups successful and how funding affects the local economy. Some of the key things we’re digging into include how investors behave, what funding sources are most common (like venture capital or angel investors), and how funding ties into the overall journey of a startup.</p>

    <p>By looking at the visualizations, we can get a better sense of funding gaps or imbalances, whether by industry, location, or growth stage. That can tell us where investors are focusing their attention and where there might be overlooked opportunities. For example, areas with high average funding usually point to strong startup communities, while places with less funding might be facing challenges or just haven’t been fully tapped into yet.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
    <p>Our dataset for this project was sourced from GitHub and focuses on startups in the San Francisco Bay Area. It contains around 7,000 rows and 38 columns, with detailed information on each company’s name, website, industry category, market type, funding total (USD), status, and location.</p>

    <p>It also includes the number of funding rounds, key founding dates, and the timeline of funding activity (first and last funding dates). A major strength of the dataset is its breakdown of funding types—such as seed, venture capital, angel investment, private equity, convertible notes, debt financing, and more—as well as detailed columns for funding rounds A through H.</p>

    <p>This structure makes it possible to analyze startup growth stages, funding trends across the region, and how different types of capital support business development over time.</p>

    <h2>Line Plot – Funding Over Time</h2>
    <p>This line plot shows the temporal trend of startup funding activity. It tracks total funding over time, allowing us to observe boom and bust cycles, identify peaks in investment activity, and examine how startup funding responded to broader economic trends or technological shifts.</p>

    <h2>Sankey Diagram – Funding Flow</h2>
    <p>This Sankey diagram visualizes the flow of startups through different stages of funding rounds—grouped into 1–3 rounds, 4–6 rounds, and 7+ rounds—and how these stages connect to various funding sources. Venture capital dominates early funding, while mature startups diversify into private equity, post-IPO options, and debt financing.</p>
    <p><strong>Sankey:</strong> This Sankey diagram shows how startups transition through different funding sources as they progress from early to later funding rounds. Companies are grouped by the number of funding rounds (1–3, 4–6, or 7+), and the flows represent the types of funding they receive, such as venture capital, private equity, debt financing, and others.</p>
    <p>Venture capital stands out as the dominant funding source across all stages, especially in the early and mid rounds. In the 1–3 round range, startups mostly rely on venture, angel, seed, and convertible note funding — typical for early-stage growth. As companies move into 4–6 rounds, they continue to depend heavily on venture capital but also start accessing private equity, debt financing, and post-IPO options, indicating a shift toward more mature funding strategies.</p>
    <p>By the 7+ round stage, funding becomes more diversified. While venture capital remains important, there’s increased reliance on private equity, debt instruments, and secondary markets. Early-stage funding types like angel and seed largely disappear at this point.</p>
    <p>Overall, the diagram highlights how startups evolve their funding approach over time — starting with informal or early-risk capital and gradually moving toward institutional and structured financial sources as they scale.</p>

    <h2>Bar Chart – Funding Rounds Distribution</h2>
    <p>This bar chart shows how many startups fall into each funding round group. The chart highlights the sharp drop-off after early funding rounds, illustrating both the challenge of continued growth and natural attrition in the startup ecosystem.</p>
    <div class="viz-container">
      <iframe src="4200PROJECT/funding_rounds_by_market.html" title="Bar Chart - Funding Rounds"></iframe>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Software</strong> is the highest-funded market, with total funding nearing $7 billion. It also has contributions from almost every round, especially rounds A to D. <strong>Biotechnology</strong> follows closely, with a slightly more balanced distribution across early (seed, round_a) and later rounds (round_b to round_d). Enterprise Software, Clean Technology, and Health Care round out the top five.</p>
    <p>Early rounds (seed, round_a) are present across all markets, indicating strong investment activity at the early startup stage. Later rounds (round_e to round_h) are rare and only show up in top-funded sectors like Software, Biotech, and Semiconductors. Round_a and round_b are the most prevalent rounds across the board, showing that many startups are making it past the seed stage but fewer proceed to advanced rounds.</p>
    <p>Some markets like “Games” and “Advertising” show a healthy range of round progression (from seed through round_d), suggesting sustained investor interest. Niche markets like File Sharing, Communities, and Big Data have significantly lower total funding and fewer funding rounds involved, possibly indicating limited scalability or investor appetite.</p>
    <p>Markets like Social Media, Messaging, and Finance seem underfunded compared to Software and Biotech, which might suggest either market saturation or higher capital efficiency. Solar and Storage have moderate investment but lack late-stage funding, possibly due to long development timelines or hardware-heavy requirements.</p>

    <h2>Box Plot – Funding Amount Distribution</h2>
    <p>This box plot presents statistical distribution of funding amounts across startup categories. It displays medians, interquartile ranges, and outliers to help identify funding variability. Outliers reveal unusually high or low investments.</p>

    <h2>Map – SF Bay Area Startup Distribution</h2>
    <p>This interactive map shows where startups are located in the San Francisco Bay Area. It visualizes clusters of innovation and helps identify regional patterns in startup funding and activity, especially around San Francisco and Silicon Valley.</p>

    <h2>Scatter Plot – Startup Age vs. Total Funding</h2>
    <p>This scatter plot explores the relationship between startup age and total funding, segmented by company status (operating, acquired, closed). It helps us understand whether age correlates with funding success and startup outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Treemap – Funding by Startup Name</h2>
    <p>This treemap visualizes the distribution of total funding by individual startup names. Larger rectangles represent companies that raised more capital. The visualization highlights key players in the funding landscape and gives a sense of capital concentration across the startup ecosystem.</p>
