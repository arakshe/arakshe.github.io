      <h1>Startup Funding Analysis Report</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Startup funding is a key factor in how successful a business can be. It drives growth, supports innovation, and gives us a bigger picture of what’s happening in the market and economy. By looking at where the money is going, through different funding rounds, funding types, and company stages, we can learn a lot about what helps startups grow and what attracts investors.</p>
      <p>In this project, we’re analyzing startup funding trends in the San Francisco Bay Area — one of the top places in the world for tech and innovation. We’re looking at how funding changes depending on the stage of the company, its location, and the type of funding it receives. Our goal is to spot patterns that show what makes startups successful and how funding affects the local economy.</p>
      <p>Some of the key things we’re digging into include how investors behave, what funding sources are most common (like venture capital or angel investors), and how funding ties into the overall journey of a startup. By looking at the visualizations, we can get a better sense of funding gaps or imbalances, whether by industry, location, or growth stage.</p>

      <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
      <p>Our dataset for this project was sourced from GitHub and focuses on startups in the San Francisco Bay Area. It contains around 7,000 rows and 38 columns, with detailed information on each company’s name, website, industry category, market type, funding total (USD), status, and location.</p>
      <p>It also includes the number of funding rounds, key founding dates, and the timeline of funding activity (first and last funding dates). A major strength of the dataset is its breakdown of funding types—such as seed, venture capital, angel investment, private equity, convertible notes, debt financing, and more—as well as detailed columns for funding rounds A through H.</p>

      <h2>Line Plot</h2>
      <p>This line plot presents the total amount of startup funding by first funding year, from 1985 to 2014. The chart reveals important trends in venture capital investment over the decades, showing periods of rapid growth, economic correction, and industry shifts.</p>
      <p>In the early years (1985–1997), startup funding remained relatively low and stable. From 1998 to 2000, we observe a modest rise, possibly linked to the dot-com boom. A surge begins in 2004, peaking in 2007, followed by a drop in 2008 due to the financial crisis. A slight recovery appears in 2009, with gradual decline from 2010 onward.</p>

      <h2>Funding Sources Treemap</h2>
      <p>This treemap visualization explores the breakdown of funding sources startups receive across all rounds. Each block represents a funding type (e.g., venture capital, private equity, convertible notes), sized by the total amount raised. It helps us understand which capital types dominate in the Bay Area and how their presence shifts as startups grow.</p>
      <p>Venture capital remains the most prevalent funding source, followed by convertible notes and angel investments in early stages. As startups mature, we see a growing role of private equity, debt financing, and even post-IPO funding.</p>
      <p>The treemap's layout allows for quick comparison between funding types, revealing not only which are most common, but also which ones tend to attract the largest investments overall.</p>

      <h2>Bar Chart</h2>
      <p>Software is the highest-funded market, with total funding nearing $7 billion. It also has contributions from almost every round, especially rounds A to D. Biotechnology follows closely, with a more balanced distribution across early and later rounds. Enterprise Software, Clean Technology, and Health Care round out the top five.</p>
      <p>Early rounds are active across all markets, but late-stage funding is rare and concentrated in key sectors. Markets like Games and Advertising show healthy progression, while File Sharing, Communities, and Big Data show lower totals and limited rounds.</p>

      <h2>Box Plot</h2>
      <p>This enhanced box plot shows the distribution of funding amounts across different startup funding rounds (A through G). Each box shows the interquartile range, and dots represent outliers. Later rounds show wider spreads and higher medians.</p>

      <h2>Interactive Map</h2>
      <p>This visualization highlights the geographic diversity of startup activity within the Bay Area. It shows average startup funding and startup density by city. San Francisco leads in volume, but Milpitas and Palo Alto show higher average funding levels.</p>

      <h2>Heatmap</h2>
      <p>This heatmap visualizes total startup funding by market and startup name initials. Darker shades show higher funding. Enterprise Software, Clean Tech, and Hardware + Software dominate. Markets like Games and Communities have lower totals.</p>
