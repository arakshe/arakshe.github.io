    <h1>Startup Funding Analysis Report</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Startup funding is a key factor in how successful a business can be. It drives growth, supports innovation, and gives us a bigger picture of what’s happening in the market and economy. By looking at where the money is going, through different funding rounds, funding types, and company stages, we can learn a lot about what helps startups grow and what attracts investors.</p>
    <p>In this project, we’re analyzing startup funding trends in the San Francisco Bay Area — one of the top places in the world for tech and innovation. We’re looking at how funding changes depending on the stage of the company, its location, and the type of funding it receives. Our goal is to spot patterns that show what makes startups successful and how funding affects the local economy.</p>
    <p>Some of the key things we’re digging into include how investors behave, what funding sources are most common (like venture capital or angel investors), and how funding ties into the overall journey of a startup. By looking at the visualizations, we can get a better sense of funding gaps or imbalances, whether by industry, location, or growth stage.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
    <p>Our dataset for this project was sourced from GitHub and focuses on startups in the San Francisco Bay Area. It contains around 7,000 rows and 38 columns, with detailed information on each company’s name, website, industry category, market type, funding total (USD), status, and location.</p>
    <p>It also includes the number of funding rounds, key founding dates, and the timeline of funding activity (first and last funding dates). A major strength of the dataset is its breakdown of funding types—such as seed, venture capital, angel investment, private equity, convertible notes, debt financing, and more—as well as detailed columns for funding rounds A through H.</p>

    <h2>Line Plot</h2>
    <p>This line plot presents the total amount of startup funding by first funding year, from 1985 to 2014. The chart reveals important trends in venture capital investment over the decades...</p>

    <h2>Treemap – Funding Sources by Rounds</h2>
    <p>This treemap shows how startups transition through different funding sources as they progress from early to later funding rounds. Companies are grouped by number of funding rounds (1–3, 4–6, or 7+), and the rectangles represent the types of funding they receive (venture, private equity, debt financing, etc.).</p>
    <p>Venture capital dominates all stages but is especially dominant in early rounds. As startups mature, we see increased use of private equity and structured financing like debt. The treemap helps visualize the evolving funding strategy of growing companies.</p>

    <h2>Box Plot</h2>
    <p>The box plot reveals clear patterns in startup funding distributions across funding rounds (A through G). Early rounds (Round A and B) show relatively lower median funding amounts, typically under $20 million, reflecting the initial funding stages with modest financial commitments. As startups progress to later rounds (Rounds C, D, E, and particularly F and G), median funding substantially increases, highlighting growing investor confidence and larger-scale investments as companies mature. The significant presence of outliers, especially in earlier rounds, indicates certain startups secured exceptionally high funding compared to their peers, suggesting occasional investor enthusiasm or market speculation in select startups. The interactive tooltip feature provides additional context, allowing detailed exploration of individual funding amounts, medians, and quartiles, enhancing the analytical depth. Overall, this analysis underscores a consistent growth trajectory in investment amounts as startups advance through funding stages, with notable variability and exceptional cases in early funding rounds.</p>
